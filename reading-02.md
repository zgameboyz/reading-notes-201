# I will take notes on my reading related to Text, Intro CSS, Basic JavaScript Instructions, and Decisions and Loops.

### Text
The text in HTML within certain elements is used to make up the header body and footer of a website. 

Certin tags such as the header provide a location too of where the text is to be placed. 

It really helps keep it orgainized.


### Introduction to CSS
CSS uses each individual element to style the website. It is as if the elements are in a box that can be modified.

You have to use selectors to decide which specific element you are targetting.

There are different type of selectors used to target different elements.

There are two parts to declaring css to change you first decide which element then decide what to change such as the font-family. 

CSS can be in the html or in it's own document. It is best practice to have it seperated.

### Basic Javascript Instructions
Javascript is a series of instructions to direct how the website acts. 

Scripts can ask for and store information in variables and even use that information to provide a service to the user. 

There are arrays which store a lot of information into a variable that differers bya  number.


### Descisions and Loops
Loops are a very important part of programming. They allow you to repeat code or continue to ask a user a question until a correct response is given.

They use comparison operators to evaluate booleans such as is 2>3  if it is do something.

All values are either Truthy of Falsy.

There are 3 main types of loops :

- for
- while
- do while

They all accomplish different things.
