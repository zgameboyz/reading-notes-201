# I will take notes on my reading related to Html structure, markup, html5 layout , and process and design.

The structure and tags are important to learning HTML. The tags are referred to as elements. for example ```<div>``` is an element.

The placement of tags is important to learn.

It is important to establish the ```<!DOCTYPE HTML>``` at the start of the index.html file. This lets the browser know the file is a webpage. 

It is important to remember when using HTML 5 that older browers need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

You must know your target audience when creating your website. Having this in mind will help you create more focused websites that will allow you to get the attention you desire and not leave the user confused.
