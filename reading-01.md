# I will take notes on my reading related to Html structure, markup, html5 layout , and process and design.

### Html Structure
The structure and tags are important to learning HTML. The tags are referred to as elements. for example ```<div>``` is an element.


The placement of tags is important to learn.


### Markup 
It is important to establish the ```<!DOCTYPE HTML>``` at the start of the index.html file. This lets the browser know the file is a webpage. 

### HTML 5 Layout
It is important to remember when using HTML 5 that older browers need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

### Process and Design
You must know your target audience when creating your website. Having this in mind will help you create more focused websites that will allow you to get the attention you desire and not leave the user confused.
