The story goes on to explain the differences between the two groups and how the former group was only really good before work came and dissolved afterwards. The latter group stayed together for 2 years after even though there was no obligation. The article then examines reasons why certain group dynamics work.

 This quote from the article explains that the most successful groups were the groups that valued each member's voice. The groups where only a couple or one person spoke the collective group suffered. Another good factor was that the succeeding teams had memebers that had a good level of emotional IQ or social sensitivity. Overall a team that listens and values eachother is a team that will succeed.
