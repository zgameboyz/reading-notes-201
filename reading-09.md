# I will take notes on my reading related to Forms, Lists, Tables, and Js Events

### Forms

A form element is used to create a form. 


There are many different type of forms used to collect information. Such as a checkbox, dropdown menu, radio button, or even text input. You can even mask the input by using a password input form. If you want to use an image for a button you can do an input with the tupe image then an image source.

### Lists, and Tables

There are many different ways to format lists. You can use standard dots for unordered lists or even pictures. There are default ones such as squares, dashes, and circles. Ordered lists can even include decimals with a leading zero, letters, and suprisingmly roman numerals. The markers can even be positioned using code.

Tables is largely a review at this point but something new was that you can remove the border from a td in a table.
You can also make the spaces larger.


### Js Events

Interactions will trigger events to occur and the event triggers code to be ran. This allows the code to essentially respond to the user without a programmer being involved. 

```

load          Web page has finished loading 


unload        Web page is unloading (usually because a new page was requested) 


error         Browser encounters a JavaScript error or an asset doesn't exist 


resize        Browser window has been resized


scroll        User has scrolled up or down the page 


### KEYBOARDEVENTS       Occur when a user interacts with the keyboard (see also input event)

MOUSE EVENTS          Occur when a user interacts with a mouse. trackpad, or touchscreen
