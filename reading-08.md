# I will take notes on my reading related to Layouts

### Layouts Review
```<div>``` elements are used as dividers in html. Browsers will display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. 
The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. 

Grids are important to creating flexible and nice looking designs.
Css Frameworks provide rules for commons taks. And you can have multiple stylesheets for one page.

Liquid and fixed positioning is important to consider when thinking about sizing things on a webpage. The sizes of the webpages change depending on the window it is viewed on. This can lead to unintended changes to the design of the page. In order to combat this a combination of fixed and liquid elements can help. 

Layout Grids help make professional looking webpages by ordering the design of the website. According to the reading a popular css framework for grids is the 960 grid system. 

Remember that you can have multiple style sheets.
