# I will take notes on my reading related to Lists and Boxes

### Lists
There are 3 main types of lists:
* Ordered Lists 
* Unordered Lists
* Definition Lists

Ordered Lists Will number the items by row when creating a new item. 

Unordered lists will create bullet points like the list above. 

Definition Lists are used to create definitions of words.


### Boxes
There are 4 main Components of Boxes from inwards to outwards:
* Content 
* Padding
* Border
* Margins

The content in a box is stored in the most center of the box. The padding will surround the content and create a buffer between the content and the border. The border will be the last buffer between the padding and the margins. The Margins seperate the box from the website sides. 


### Basic Javascript Instructions
Javascript is a series of instructions to direct how the website acts. 

Scripts can ask for and store information in variables and even use that information to provide a service to the user. 

There are arrays which store a lot of information into a variable that differers bya  number.


### Descisions and Loops
Loops are a very important part of programming. They allow you to repeat code or continue to ask a user a question until a correct response is given.

They use comparison operators to evaluate booleans such as is 2>3  if it is do something.

All values are either Truthy of Falsy.

There are 3 main types of loops :

- for
- while
- do while

They all accomplish different things.
