# I will take notes on my reading related to Object Literals and Document Object Model

### Object Literals
Objects are groups of variables and functions that represent a real world model.

In an object the variables are called properties.

In an object functions become methods.

For example a hotel has many properties such as a name, num of rooms, booked, might have a gym, or room types.

objects are created by ```var hotel ={}```

you can reference properties or methods using dot notation such as hotel.name

### Document Object Model
The DOM tree is a model of a webpage.

There are 4 types of nodes: Document Nodes, Element Nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or by using the css selector syntax.

Whenever a DOM query returns more than one node it will always be returned as a NodeList.

An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.

In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent. 

Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
