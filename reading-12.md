# I will take notes on my reading related to charts

## Charts.js

There is an open source chart creating css library called charts.js on github. From what I understand you can download then use their class to create complex charts for your pages.  There are bar charts, pie charts, and line charts. You can find out more [here](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/).


You can make these charts by utilizing the ```<canvas>``` tag. You can explicitly designate a width and height. Otherwise, it will default to 300px by 150px. You may draw shapes on canvas using certain functions like the draw() command. With skill and artistic talent you can create all sorts of images using these basic shapes.

Colors and styles can be created as well. There is a fill style and stroke style the formor is used for filling shapes while the latter creates style for the outline of shapes. Gradients can be created as well including radial gradients. Patterns are also created this way too!.

Text can be styled using the draw function as well. You can create text and style it.
