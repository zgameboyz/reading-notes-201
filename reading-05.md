# I will take notes on my reading related to Images, Color and Text.

### Images
It is important to remember images used need to be either free to use or purchased. Also, The pictures should fit the color scheme of the website and should convey the correct mood. 

```<img>``` is used to add an image into the page using html. The height and width of the image are adjustable. 
You can even align the picture. 

Jpeg, Gif, and PNG are used as image types. 


### Color
There is foreground and background coloring. The foreground is used for text while the background is the color of the page itself. You can identify colors by a name, rgb value, or a hex code. 

There is also the hue, saturation, and brightness to consider. 

Color pickers are great tools to find the right colors. 



### Text

Text can have different weight, style, and stretch values.
Weight is basically how bold it is. Style changes the font. Stretch values can change the spacing and length of the letters.

You may also change the font size based on points. Text can be aligned to different areas on the screen as well.
