# I will take notes on my reading related to Images and Practical Information

### Images

Images can be used for all sorts of things. Images are great as backgrounds as used by the background-image css rule. They can also supplement a page and be good as a descriptor. Sometimes you may even choose to repeat an image to make it span a page. You can move the position of the image as well. There are certain things you can do as well such as a Rollover image which changes when the mouse rolls over it. Gradients are neat too they make a picture fade out or fade in as you go down. This may be useful to put it under text then have it come back as it comes out of the text. 

### Practical Information

SEO meaning search engine optimization is about helping a website appear more often on search engines. It is important to make keywords that you want to be searhable on a search engine.  Having other sites link to your site is also great. Some important places to put desired words are in the title and header of areas. In the text you may want to repeat phrases. Linking text is good too. Google will allow you to put tracking analytics on your websites to see how your users use your website. Other websites can provide useful things such as blogging, email, or ecommerce to help you not have to create something from scratch.
