# I will take notes on my reading related to Links, Layouts, Functions, Methods and objects, and 6 Reasons for Pair Programming.

### Links
Links are created using the ```<a>``` element.

It is used with the href attribute like ```<a href = https://www.example.com>``` with a url. 
If you are linking to your own site use relative links rather than qualified URLS.

You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the to field. 

You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


### Layouts
```<div>``` elements are used as dividers in html. Browsers will display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning. 
The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. 

Grids are important to creating flexible and nice looking designs.
Css Frameworks provide rules for commons taks. And you can have multiple stylesheets for one page.



### Functions
Functions are specific instructions used to create a task and they are created in the format of. You can have **anonymous functions** which are assigned to a variable and have no name. Variables created in a function are scoped to only work inside the function.
 ```
function example(parameters){
some code to run here.
}
```



### 6 Reasons For pair programming

In pair programming there is a Driver and a Navigator. The Driver will type out the code while the Navigator will direct the driver what to do.

It increases efficiency by allowing 2 people to catch mistakes. Research says pair programming takes slightly longer but creates better code. Which in the end saves time because better code has less errors to go back and fix. 

It also increases collaboration which allows partners to stay on topic.

Sometimes you may need to lean on the other person for help.

It helps bolster your communication skills. 

A common step in interviewing is pair programming with a current developer at a company and you must show you care capable.

Many companies use pair programming for new employees as well.
